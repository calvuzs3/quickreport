/**
 * DAO for the maintenance_logs table.

 * Read contract: all normal queries filter WHERE is_deleted = 0.
 * Write contract: insert only — logs are content-immutable after creation.
 *   Lifecycle fields (is_active, is_deleted, updated_at) are updated via
 *   dedicated targeted queries, not via a generic @Update.
 *
 * Aggregate queries power [GetIslandHealthSummaryUseCase] — all are offline,
 * no external dependencies.
